              I graduated a higher vocational education in Frontend Development
              at Jensen Yrkesh√∂gskola in Sweden Stockholm in 2024. Currently, I
              am searching for a developer-focused role to hone my skills whilst
              building beautiful web services.

                During my education, I got proficient in using the basics like
                HTML, CSS, and JS. We also built apps with React, mobile apps
                with Expo Go. During an internship of 3 months, I also had the
                pleasure of working with TypeScript.
                <br />I now work as a psychiatric care assistant within Northern
                Stockholm Psychiatry. In my free time, I am studying computer
                science through Harvard&apos;s CS50 Resources and coding
                websites like these to continuously learn more!
