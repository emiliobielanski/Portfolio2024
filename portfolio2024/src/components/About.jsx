                I graduated a higher vocational education in Frontend
                Development at Jensen Yrkesh√∂gskola in Sweden Stockholm in 2024.
                Currently I am searching for a developer focused role to hone my
                skills whilst building beautiful web services.

                  During my education, I got proficient in using the basics like
                  HTML, CSS and JS. We also built apps with React, Mobile apps
                  with Expo Go. During an internship of 3 months I also had the
                  pleasure of working with TypeScript.

                  I now work as a psychiatric care assistant within Northern Stockholms Psychiatry. In my free time, I am studying computer science through Harvards CS50 Resources and coding websites like these to continously learn more!
